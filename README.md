# docker-project
Very delighted to complete my docker project after completion of docker training under the Linux world informatics ltd initiative 
IIEC-RISE under the world record holder Mr Vimal Daga sir.

ABOUT THE PROJECT :-
I had created a multi-tier Architecture to cope up with the real world problems that we face,
the infrastructure consists use of Docker container which are so faster that it can install and give an interacting interface to user just in a second and thereby saving our time so in this project i created a webapp of my own using the open source content management tool Joomla 3.9.16 ,linked mysql:5.7 as a database server and by using docker-compose made a multitier infrastructure 
as a code 

Following are the steps required to get the complete detup ready:-
step 1:
I used basically two docker containers so we need to pull these images: 
1.)mysql:5.7 and 
2.)joomla:3.9.16-php7.3-apache 
these images can be pull using the command ->docker pull mysql:5.7
and ->docker pull joomla:3.9.16-php7.3-apache

step 2:
